Quick-and-dirty temporary replacement for Unity GUIText stuff

NOTE: this uses the old GUI system to "Sorta" replace the GUIText
and GUITexture classes, which went away in Unity2019 or so.

Use at your own peril, see the enclosed license file.

NOTE: This is not a 1-1 replacement, but rather a start.

NOTE: if you have improvements, commit them and send me a pull request!
